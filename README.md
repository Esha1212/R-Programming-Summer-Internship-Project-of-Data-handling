# R-Programming-Summer-Internship-Project-of-Data-handling
During my R Programming Summer Internship, I worked on a data handling project aimed at analyzing customer purchasing patterns to provide insights for business strategy development.
Project Description

Data Collection: Acquired data from online retail databases and company-provided datasets.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values using imputation methods, removed duplicates, and transformed data for uniformity.
Data Manipulation: Utilized dplyr for data manipulation tasks such as filtering, summarizing, and joining datasets.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations using ggplot2 to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.
Statistical Analysis: Applied regression analysis to predict future sales trends based on historical data.
Tools and Technologies

R Packages: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, data.table
Development Environment: RStudio
Challenges and Solutions

Faced inconsistencies in data formats which were resolved by creating custom functions for data transformation.
Developed efficient code for handling large datasets to optimize processing time.
Contributions

Took charge of data cleaning and preprocessing stages, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
Collaborated with a team of data analysts to develop predictive models.
Outcomes and Learnings

Successfully identified key customer segments and purchasing trends.
Enhanced my skills in data handling, R programming, and statistical analysis.
